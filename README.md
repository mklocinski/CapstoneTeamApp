# Main Points
- This interface was created as part of a project that sought to apply XAI and RAI principles to an autonomous vehicle DRL. It allows you to analyze the training of a drone swarm DRL with the option to adjust swarm parameters and responsibility constraints (i.e. don't hit obstacles)
- This interface was built with Dash, and integrates an OpenAI Assistant by including a chat box. 
- You **can't** run this without the [API]((https://github.com/mklocinski/CapstoneTeamAPI))
